Can\\'t wait till we finally get an answer or a conclusion or we\\'re left hanging for all eternity and forever have to deal with this thing.\\n\\nStay tuned.\\nUser 3: Ever seen shrooms?\\nUser 2: I loled, I don\\'t know haha, I\\'ve always been \"curious\" since I was a kid about it but never tried it, got a suspicious dealer with a lethal record too.\\nUser 1: Sending good vibes your super lucky to not be hooked enough and in the substitute and your lucky your principle and 1 had only a few bad wraps.\\nUser 2: It\\'s a funny thing I decided to take that term \"curious\" and put it to good use rather than bad to be honest, it stopped me from doing stupid things and gave me a clear head.\\n\\nWe all get curious at times and some are not so successful on finding the answers, so making a decision to put off the curiosity for later was the logical move for a kid, I\\'ve got friends my age now that started at my age and they threw their lives in the gutter. I always wonder whenever I see them, where would they be if they haven\\'t gotten hooked on those nasty substances.   \\n  \\n I used to be worried about that too, got attacked for saying I don\\'t take drugs (but I liked to smoke Weed) and the next day I come back I get mugged and my phone gets nicked, and so it goes on, I just avoid it, I don\\'t drink either and for some reason, people like you know what, don\\'t mess with them when they\\'re in the presence of other people, they only do it when they\\'re alone. \\n\\nOh and, thanks for the good vibes :) dang right!\\nUser 1: Don’t be afraid to take five I don’t smoke weed but you ever smoked from a bowl? Love how weed does me in 10 minutes I And I don’t ever feel even a buzz from smoking weed and it takes me 4 hours to feel high which I enjoy them a lot more\\nUser 2: Oh yeah definitely do, create a bunch of peace and calm when smoking a bowl, I\\'ve never gotten high from it and I\\'ve had so many ways of smoking weed, the first month ingested and now I fully switched to vaping it and I enjoy it, gives you a lot less of the head rush, less coughing as well.  \\n\\nSmoking weed is good for me, it makes me feel good overall, got my mental state in check, y\\'know.\\n\\nI still have a headache from that one point when I went dry, my weed supplier hasn\\'t been online, it\\'s been almost 2 days now and y\\'know, it\\'s bad...\\nUser 1: Oh boy it used to be a monthly trip to get a 10 a month to get my script of CBD cigarettes but they wanted 250 a month fml that’s ok tho I’m in my state slinging cbd 60 dollars a cup I use  it to teach the life world and if they like how it feels and want to try cannabis then I make a referral fee 850 for a referral so I use it as the gateway drug back into the world when done properly it opens doors instead closing them\\nUser 2: Oooo that\\'s fair enough then, financialIy wise it\\'s profitable for the one selling, if someone goads you into pushing H, don\\'t do it, Ever.\\n\\nThat\\'s true, heck yeah, I love being high, best night I had a while back was using all my vape\\'s oil in one night and got extremely stoned, did a bunch of stuff, even made a game, I have good memories of that night, it felt like a breakthrough.\\nUser 1: Sounds like you really needed that break through other wise you may not be posting here on Reddit 💗 thanks big energy 💗 I got told to shut up by a prominent lawyer when a guy was grabbing grocery for the kids as a rottweiler attacked his kids\\nWent up in front of a judge told him to his face and a bunch more than that and judge said next time you want to beat the shit out of a dog fine as long as the kids are never\\nIn danger of you hurting them reading gifts getting ready for his sister who had helped get custody from a eviction then sure Pennsylvania rewards dramatic gestures and dramatics and if I was homophobic and proud are is from our state as I mercilessly murdered all of them and alive for days which we both know I’m not but it would also get unwarranted attention\\nUser 2: I totally agree with you man and respect you for doing that. There\\'s a prominent vet around my neighbourhood and I heard about a dog in trouble with another, it comes down to being good or being alpha \"male.\"\\n\\nPeople claim that ASPCA (The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) gives you money for being out there for the rights of animals but I\\'ve never heard of it, it sounds like you\\'re protecting the rights of the child with that dramatic and justified gesture.\\n\\na for animals and  a for people. A lot of people are reluctant to admit it but we are smart enough to look out for animals for a couple of reasons. People who say \"it\\'s just a dog\" are wrong, they are part of the evolutionary chain and they\\'re just like us, not physically and atm anyway but in terms of how much they develop, they are just too dumb to not go in the path of evolution.\\n\\nSo, yeah man, you deserve to have that child no matter what cost it is, you gave a kid a chance to live.  \\nYou should post that story here and also on the main subreddit, I wanna see the comments.\\n\\nAnd as you very well put it, if I could get roped into smoking heroin anytime now, not doing it, not even partaking it.\\nUser 1: Aspca don’t give a single fuck about animals or your money in many many cases it’s good that they are here for farm animals cuz the live on ground zero of every major contamination event ever\\nAlso why can’t domesticated animals be with our chains 🤯\\nUser 2: They don\\'t care if an animal suffers or not, the thing is, people keep donating to them in the name of \"championing the rights of animals\" but they waste all the money on luxury, not on exaggerating or over paying their staff but actual luxury,  I do not approve of that, I just don\\'t do such things.\\n\\nTHAT\\'S IT! We should create a brand of vocal chains, heck yeah, I would wear that artsy pedesnd, it goes disgustingly well.  \\n  \\nI\\'ll drop drawings in the morning, I shall try my hand at it.  \\n\\nTBH I barley know how to keep animals, I don\\'t have pets but I approve of have some, I\\'ve kept hamsters, my girlfriend got one and it was so cool to see it running around in the Hamster run.\\nUser 1: I love doing slow release breeds 🤯 heard a screaming baby in waste river and pulled out 5 pups with the mother was in great health and helped build a healthy population so now they out recvhnization monastor mississippi river her in greater numbers than the Triceratops about 6 million of them there is a refugee in Tennessee right now weird right? Anyway to the point they aren’t classified as wild and are domesticated SOOOOO we should be able to domesticate and intensively breed wild animals for food and bug pests we have so many animals gonna make a self sufficient biosphere this year in my red zone so they aren’t destroying the land I only deface government property if they do it first which they have and will continue.
