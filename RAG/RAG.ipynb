      "[Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"so Hello friends welcome back to Pap coders we are back with a new video in this video we are going to learn a very New Concept which is coin like this coin is used for dependency injection we will come to know that how we are going to use dependency injection using coin and how is this coin different from dagger hild I hope so you guys have watched our playlist and this we have explained that what is this dagger H let me just redirect you to the video which I'm referring to actually you can visit papaya codas then move to the playlist section you can see a Android tutorial English playlist over here and here we have a video where you can understand dagger Hil and its implementation we have two crash courses one of them is on XML and another one is on Jetpack compos you can definitely go to through it and we also have a dedicated movie app in which I have explained what is rx Java and how we are going to make two simultaneous API calls using single do zip method so make sure that you\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"to through it and we also have a dedicated movie app in which I have explained what is rx Java and how we are going to make two simultaneous API calls using single do zip method so make sure that you check out these videos these are very interesting videos so yeah let's get back to our topic that what is going and how this thing is is different from dagger H okay so I hope so you have subscribed to our Channel and make sure you hit the Bell icon so that you get all of our latest updates first so let's get started okay so first thing what is coin the main thing is why we are using coin and what is coin coin is a programmatically designed dependency injection framework specifically for cotland okay okay remember this line it is specifically for cotlin it is purely written in cotlin means no code generation and no reflection shall occur and we are using DSL which is domain specific language for configurations and it can designed to be lightweight and straightforward it focus on practical\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"code generation and no reflection shall occur and we are using DSL which is domain specific language for configurations and it can designed to be lightweight and straightforward it focus on practical usage rather than complex configurations like if you have used dagger Hilt in any of your programs if you are not aware of dagger Hilt let me just show you with a quick video like you can see over here I have implemented dagger Hil over here okay I need to update few of my components that's why it's showing error over here otherwise this code is completely correct as you can see I have used dagger over here so you can see that how complex is this thing in actual like this dagger H is very useful for scanable projects but I must say that if you're working on a smaller project then this dagger held is little bit complex for beginners also and to implement also so if our use case is not that scalable or it is limited then we can definitely go for this coin okay and since this is written\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='held is little bit complex for beginners also and to implement also so if our use case is not that scalable or it is limited then we can definitely go for this coin okay and since this is written purely in cotland so we have an upper hand also okay so what are the core principles of coin right we have a module here as we can see over here we have a module app module we also are going to make a module layer in our coin app also and coin implements the service locator pattern uh Central module maintain all the dependencies and all other components request the dependency from this module like how let me show you let us see where is this app module called this app module might be called inside our view models let me guess okay as you can see this is called in a view model so whenever this view model is called like just let me explain you how the things are actually working so this view model Au view model is actually dependent on the repository and the profile image manager okay so means'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"model is called like just let me explain you how the things are actually working so this view model Au view model is actually dependent on the repository and the profile image manager okay so means this allu model require these two two files to work clear and since we are using dagger hild here so it is the work of dagger hild to provide these dependencies whenever OD model requires them it is clear I hope so it was very simple explanation so means whenever any class requires any dependency for its working so dagger is responsible for bringing those dependencies to it so that it can function like in our case Au view model require the repository and profile image manager for functioning so this dagger is going to bring all of the resources and provide it to the Au model so that it can function okay don't worry we are not going to copy this code we are going to write the whole code from the scratch not this one just a new project but for now just understand that what I'm trying to say\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"okay don't worry we are not going to copy this code we are going to write the whole code from the scratch not this one just a new project but for now just understand that what I'm trying to say that like what is the work of this dagger H or coin like what are they actually doing okay so how they are bringing it let me just show you let's go to the app module and here we can see we have an au provide Au repository okay so we have called this method in our Au model so this method requires Au and fire store for functioning so dagger will keep keep the track of this and whenever the things are required it will provide them okay so let's now move forward to our coin we have a simple repository system over here like we have in the dagger H also we are going to have our dependency injection layer in that we are going to call our methods okay we have something called dependency resolution like going uses function function type declaration components okay and the resolution is done at the\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"layer in that we are going to call our methods okay we have something called dependency resolution like going uses function function type declaration components okay and the resolution is done at the runtime okay and it is Lazy by default means whenever it is required then only we are going to provide the dependency resolution okay you will get to know just be with me I will explain everything pretty well okay for now just try to grab has all the knowledge which I'm just trying to tell you okay we have something called scope management also and go in which is like Global scope which is the default scope for single instances we will understand what is single instances what is view model and what is this Factory okay and we have few custom Scopes also then we have some different types of styles to declare our dependency like we have a direct dependency declaration then we have something called interface binding and we have some different injection methods like we have Constructor\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"of styles to declare our dependency like we have a direct dependency declaration then we have something called interface binding and we have some different injection methods like we have Constructor injection dependency provide through the Constructor and like many other things don't worry I will make you do a very small project in that we will understand everything in super detail okay so what we shall do is now go to our Android studio and create a new file and there we shall understand everything let's go for it select this compose one and let's name it as coin let the gdle sync meanwhile just be with me and we will understand this thing very well okay we are just going to mimic like a very small project we are just here to understand the Core Concepts of coin we are not here to make a very full-fledged app if you want a full-fledged app I have already covered it inside our movie app which you can definitely go and refer like I have explained everything like how to use coin inside\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"very full-fledged app if you want a full-fledged app I have already covered it inside our movie app which you can definitely go and refer like I have explained everything like how to use coin inside that movie app which I was referring at the starting okay that where we are going to use single zip method to call two API simultaneously that one okay so basic thing first let's go to our gridle file and add the dependencies for our coin so okay so let me just copy the dependency which we are going to actually use let's come over here let me just change this comp L SDK then the version which we are going to actually use is 3.4.0 which is the stable one okay let's enclose this thing and I hope so we are good to go let me see okay a new version is available let's update it to 3.55 and let's sync the project then we are just going to mimic a small project in which we are going to load the user like no actual data shall be loaded but we are going to learn that how that loading can be made\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"sync the project then we are just going to mimic a small project in which we are going to load the user like no actual data shall be loaded but we are going to learn that how that loading can be made easy using coin okay just let it sing here okay first of all what we need to do is to create our data value let's come inside this and inside this let's create a new package name it as data and inside this data we want to create a data class let's create another package and name it as models and inside as models let us have our first model which is users okay let it be a data class so we will have very simple thing like uh Val ID which is going to be of typend then we will have a name and email okay it was showing me some suggestions Yep this email one okay so that is pretty much for our user right now like we don't want our app to be very complex for starting let's keep it simple then let's have a data source layer so let's create a data source package over here inside this data source\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"right now like we don't want our app to be very complex for starting let's keep it simple then let's have a data source layer so let's create a data source package over here inside this data source let's have an interface Let It Be user data source okay great now let us create some functions which are actually going to mimic the methods like getting the user or getting the user by ID like something like that like we are trying to load the data from Firebase or any other okay okay like this one I think so this thing is hearing me is pretty Advanced right now right and let's have another suspend function okay this is impressive like this is what actually I wanted just the name is a little bit different okay we have two methods over here one of them is to get the user and this will return us a list of users and this is like a spend function get users by ID this will take ID as an input and then it will return us something of type users let us make them nullable okay now what we can do is\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"a list of users and this is like a spend function get users by ID this will take ID as an input and then it will return us something of type users let us make them nullable okay now what we can do is like implementation of data source we need that too let's add user data source okay now what we are going to do for the abstraction sake we have this as an interface and now we are going to expose this to our rest of the application so this user data source implementation will extend the user data source yeah this one and then let's continue let's have a private Val of type users which is equal to mutable State mutable list of actually let me get the mutable list Yep this one mutable list so of let's say users so let us create some Dum users okay let me just have a d user the first Dem user shall be like the ID is one then we can name it as Pap coders and let's have an email also okay so this is our Dum user let's have another Dum user okay great we have these things implemented over here\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"be like the ID is one then we can name it as Pap coders and let's have an email also okay so this is our Dum user let's have another Dum user okay great we have these things implemented over here this is showing me a little bit of error let me just resolve this okay this is asking me to import the dependency which I don't want cuz I'm not using such method okay I missed a comma over here that was the issue okay now what is this make user data source simp implementation abstract no why would I okay let's just implement the members we want to implement few members which we have generated let us add those methods yep implement the members let's Implement our members okay great and what we want to do since we are here not to do anything just here to understand the thing so let's just make it equal to the users and this to we can just remove this to-do from here and simply let's just remove this thing and we can make it something like let me just yep users do find and what we are going to\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"equal to the users and this to we can just remove this to-do from here and simply let's just remove this thing and we can make it something like let me just yep users do find and what we are going to find the particular user it do ID equal to ID okay this was very clean and very simple now let's go to our module layer again and create a new repository okay let's create a new great now inside this repository let us create our user repository okay so okay this user repository will actually require our data source okay so let us give it as in Constructor now as you can see this repository actually requires this thing for its function no so whenever this things will be required it will provide it by coin okay we will create a dependency injection layer in that we will create a module which will keep the all the things like handle all these things okay let's have a private 12 of type user data source and this will be of type user data source okay so inside this what we are going to do\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"will keep the all the things like handle all these things okay let's have a private 12 of type user data source and this will be of type user data source okay so inside this what we are going to do inside our repository we are going to to have a suspend function to get all users and to get the users okay so let's have a function this was our method and what we are going to do is simply we're going to use our data source dot get users okay and then next thing let's have another suspend function which will be get users like if you want to get a specific user then what we shall do we shall use get user by ID method Yep this one okay so repository code is also completed now what we need to do is we need to create a use okay we need to provide it an initial ID let's pass ID over here and let's get it over here okay great now what we need to do is we need to create an implementation sorry not implementation the user cases okay so let's create a another package let's name it as use case and\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"get it over here okay great now what we need to do is we need to create an implementation sorry not implementation the user cases okay so let's create a another package let's name it as use case and what we will have inside this package is pretty simple we will have a class which will show the further implementation let's have it so I'm keeping this thing in mind that you have a basic idea about MV M so I'm not explaining like what is data layer what is data source what is model I hope so you have watched our videos and these things are pretty clear to you if you have any doubts please feel free to comment and you can obviously watch all our previous videos your concept would be Crystal Clear if you watch our mvvm videos okay so inside this get users use case we will have an implementation of our repository because this files requires our repository Yep this one let's import our repository and let's remove this so what we are going to do we are going to have a suspend function sorry\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"of our repository because this files requires our repository Yep this one let's import our repository and let's remove this so what we are going to do we are going to have a suspend function sorry suspend operator function invoke repository. get all users now let's create our view model before that what we can do okay now let's create a view model then only at last we would Implement our dependency injection layer actually that di layer or app module generally consist of all the third party calls like if you want to make any third party calls for example Firebase or any network call so we basically initialize it at the starting of our app and I prefer to do that at very first okay so let's have a package view model inside this package let's create our user view model so what this view model is going to use this is going to use our users use case now why we have all this files if you was having repository then what is the point of using this get users use case actually you can see that\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"is going to use this is going to use our users use case now why we have all this files if you was having repository then what is the point of using this get users use case actually you can see that this thing is implementing the user data source and user data source is kind of abstracted thing like I don't want it to be exposed everywhere so that's why I'm using the get users use case to hide all of that implementation remember this like I don't never expose your secrets to anyone like never expose how you are making the API call and never expose any other things sensitive data like that just make an implementation out of them and expose that to your app okay like this user data source implementation is actually extending the user data source okay okay let's get to our user view model and this view model will require our get users use case Yep this one so what this thing is going to Simply do we will have a mutable State flow I hope you have a prior knowledge for what that like what\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"this view model will require our get users use case Yep this one so what this thing is going to Simply do we will have a mutable State flow I hope you have a prior knowledge for what that like what is this mutable State flow if you have any doubt please feel free to comment we will make a separate video on mutable State flow and mutable shared flow this is a very small topic we can cover it in within a single video okay so let's have a private well users which will be equal to mutable State flow okay let me I think so I need to type it y this one this mutable State flow would be of typ list yeah this is the exact code we actually need let's import the user and what we want is an empty list for now and then what we want to do is since we are using a mutable State flow so we need to have an initial value our initial value is mty list right now we could have a sealed class like the user data like whether the data is loading success or we are in error state so we can provide that thing\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='an initial value our initial value is mty list right now we could have a sealed class like the user data like whether the data is loading success or we are in error state so we can provide that thing over here like till the data is being loaded we could show the loading State and once the data is being loaded we can show our success State we can have some seal classes actually seed classes as like envelope so whenever we want to have specific things like the data can be either in loading State either in success or either in error state so we can use C class for that that is a whole different concept we are not here to understand that we are just here to understand what is going and how we are going to implement that inside our application but the command box is still open you can make use of it make sure that you use it let it be a state flow and state flow would be of type list of users and this thing will be equal to users do as state flow okay we are done from here now what we are'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"of it make sure that you use it let it be a state flow and state flow would be of type list of users and this thing will be equal to users do as state flow okay we are done from here now what we are going to do is to have a very small method which is basically going to load the users from our get users use case let's use our view model scope. launch method and then simply set the user value first of all we can actually set the users value to loaning and then we can try to get the user use case so that is the actual process of how to do the things but this is just a dummy app okay now let's get over here and create another main package which will be Di and this di is our dependency injection package and let's create our first app okay let's come inside over here and create an app module this would not be a class anymore we will simply have a Val app module and this thing will be equal to module now from where this module is coming you can see this is coming from Coen what is model then\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='would not be a class anymore we will simply have a Val app module and this thing will be equal to module now from where this module is coming you can see this is coming from Coen what is model then what is single and what is Factory first of all let me just write the code okay okay the signal is actually just let me complete it just a minute please just let me complete the code then it will be pretty easy for me to explain you guys okay what okay so we have three things over here first of them is single then we have a factory then we have a view model so what is this single mean single is actually like it creates a single instance of the same thing everywhere and Factory creates a new instance every time and a view model is like a special Factory for view models and then what is this thing get then this get is like an annot is a method which can be used to automatically resolve the dependencies okay now I know that this thing was not clear to you this thing was like just above your'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"get then this get is like an annot is a method which can be used to automatically resolve the dependencies okay now I know that this thing was not clear to you this thing was like just above your head now let's get into the depth and understand this in a little bit more explanatory method okay so understand single first single creates a single turn instance that persist throughout the app live cycle means we will not have any other instance of this user data source or data source implementation throughout our app okay like this is generally used for the services like if we have a network call so we want to make it single like we have a single call we don't want to make several calls to our Network then for our repositories or any class that should have only one instance like our data source in this case should have only one instance that why we are using single over here okay then the next thing which is that understand is Factory okay now this Factory creates a new instance of each\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"in this case should have only one instance that why we are using single over here okay then the next thing which is that understand is Factory okay now this Factory creates a new instance of each line whenever it each time whenever it is requested it is generally use for objects that needs a fresh state or that should not be shared okay for example this user repository we don't want to okay just a minute let me have a look I think okay just a second guys please yeah we actually don't you need the single anymore I have just repeated this thing my bad okay so this Factory generally creates a new instance of the file which we generally don't want to duplicate or we don't want it okay so this Factory is used over here as you can see it is generally used for objects that needs a fresh State means we use we need this user repository as a fresh State whenever we required it okay so the another thing is the view model and as I told you this view model is a special type of repository which is\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"we use we need this user repository as a fresh State whenever we required it okay so the another thing is the view model and as I told you this view model is a special type of repository which is basically for the view models it handles the life cycle and survives the life cycle State that's why this is a different type of factory like the instance is created but it survives the life cycle changes okay and then what is this thing get this get is like getting us all the methods automatically like just try to understands this automatically injects the things required for the user repository like our user repository requires the data source so this thing will automatically inject it over there and like our user view model also require our user get data source sorry get users use case so this get will automatically inject what is required okay so this was a very small small and very easy explanation I hope so it was clear to you okay now when we are using this dependency injection methods\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"get will automatically inject what is required okay so this was a very small small and very easy explanation I hope so it was clear to you okay now when we are using this dependency injection methods like if we have dagger or we are using something else then we basically need to create a application so let's create let us have one for our app so this application will simply extend application and this will contain an override this method is basically going to override since this my class my application is extending the parent class the parent classes application and we are going to overwrite the on create method of this okay let's so right the on create method super on create when what we are going to do we are simply going to start the coin yep start going and what we are going to start is basically Android logger and then next thing would be Android context just a minute I will explain you and in this context let us pass this as my application and we need to pass our modules over\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"is basically Android logger and then next thing would be Android context just a minute I will explain you and in this context let us pass this as my application and we need to pass our modules over here right now we have only one module which is app module if we have more than one module like I have in that movie app I would recommend you to watch our movie app after this video then it will be pretty clear for you guys like you will have a better explanation of the things okay okay then the next thing which will we shall have is to set up our manifest file inside this manifest file simply have a name which is my application okay this thing is clear now let's try to understand what is this Android logger and else things okay so this Android logger is generally used to initialize the coin built-in logger which helps in debugging on dependency injections issues it basically lcks the important coin message like dependency resolution error and life cycle events okay this logs are printed\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"built-in logger which helps in debugging on dependency injections issues it basically lcks the important coin message like dependency resolution error and life cycle events okay this logs are printed in the lock CAD under the tag coin so means whenever we are going to have any sort of error or any other thing so this Android logger will basically log it inside the log cat and we are going to see it in the runtime okay so the next thing is like what we have is Android context this Android context provide the application context to the coin this allows the coin to inject the context into the dependency wherever needed let me repeat this thing this Android context will allow the coin to inject the context into the dependencies wherever it is needed okay so why is it this important this is like many Android components like our shared preferences room database and many other things requires an application context if coin does not have the assess to the context it can't create the instance\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"many Android components like our shared preferences room database and many other things requires an application context if coin does not have the assess to the context it can't create the instance of those dependencies okay now let's have the last one which is a module app modules so basically this is registering the dependencies moduled in the coin like app module is Go's module that contain the definitions of all the dependencies and inside this then we have the single Factory and view model which is pretty clear to you right now okay now let's try to load our things inside our UI let's create a new package called screens inside this screens let's create our user screen so this is like a basic method let's have a function let's have ad composable tag to make it a UI part okay so what this user screen will actually require is view models and which would be our user view models and this shall be provided to us by coin get the view models now let's have our Val users by view models\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"this user screen will actually require is view models and which would be our user view models and this shall be provided to us by coin get the view models now let's have our Val users by view models sorry not yeah view models do users do collect the state since it was a state flow that's why we are trying to collect it as a state or let's have a launch effect first of all we can have that let's have this launch def let's provide it unit in and then what we are going to do we are going to use view model do load users then we are just simply going to load the users and then let's have a column to show the users right let's have the column inside this column we are simply going to use users dot for each for each users what we are going to use we are having that Lambda we are going to just going to show the name of the users okay let's just bring it down and import the user sorry import this text and let's set the text is equal to user dot name okay this should be curly braces actually\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"going to show the name of the users okay let's just bring it down and import the user sorry import this text and let's set the text is equal to user dot name okay this should be curly braces actually let's change this thing yeah now this thing is pretty good so we are just simply trying to load our user data from our view models and we are having a text view to show the name of the users we are using a launch effect to use it so we are simply going to call it inside our main activity let's come over here and remove this for a while and what we are going to do is basically just remove all of these things and let's have a surface actually let's provide it a modifier okay then let's call our method over here which is user screen let's import this thing let's try to fire this thing up okay we have some error okay resoled now let's try to fire this thing up and let's see how this thing is basically going to look to us like how the data is going to display with the help of coin and let's\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"we have some error okay resoled now let's try to fire this thing up and let's see how this thing is basically going to look to us like how the data is going to display with the help of coin and let's see if we have some sort of error or not okay meanwhile let me show you this expense Tracker app if this things opens on the emulator yeah so this was a app tutorial which we have on our application so basically this is an expens stacker app that uses room database and we are going to store our daily base expenses over here like you can see we have a pretty good animation we have a scroll effect and we have much more things okay then we can go inside this transaction we can have our income we can have an expense okay this thing is crashing let's close this thing and let's see okay the app crashed initially or something happened let's just see okay the app is getting crashed as soon as this things opens let's have a look in the lock at okay let's just see the coin just stop close\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"app crashed initially or something happened let's just see okay the app is getting crashed as soon as this things opens let's have a look in the lock at okay let's just see the coin just stop close application yeah here it is the error let us have a look okay the coin says no compose coin context setup default use coin Contex or Coin App function to set up or create coin context to message okay no definition type we have

      "| **Koin** | “Koin is a programmatically‑designed dependency‑injection framework specifically for Kotlin… written in Kotlin only, no code generation, no reflection, uses a DSL for configuration.” | Koin is used in Android projects to provide DI without the overhead of libraries like Dagger/Hilt. By being compile‑time safe and reflection‑free it keeps the app lightweight. |\n",
      "| **Key concepts** | • **Module** – a Kotlin `val` describing where objects come from.<br>• **`single`** – creates one *singleton* instance that is reused everywhere.<br>• **`factory`** – creates a new instance each time it is requested.<br>• **`viewModel`** – a special factory that gives a `ViewModel` instance that survives configuration changes.<br>• **`get()`** – a helper that automatically resolves a dependency defined in a module. | These concepts form the building blocks to wire up any Android component (Repository, ViewModel, Repository, DAO, etc.) in a clean, testable way. |\n",
      "| **Comparison with Dagger/Hilt** | \"Koin is different from Dagger/Hilt because it has no code generation or reflection, is written entirely in Kotlin, and focuses on practicality.\" | Developers choose Koin when they want a simpler, faster‑to‑learn DI solution that still integrates with the Android lifecycle (via `viewModel`). |\n",
      "| **Examples & use‑cases** | • A **Jetpack Compose movie app** that uses Koin extensively.<br>• A **movie‑app** demo explaining advanced RxJava usage (zip, two simultaneous API calls). | The examples show Koin in real-world projects, giving the audience a concrete reference to understand how to structure a real Android app. |\n",

      "The video introduces **Koin** as a lightweight, Kotlin‑centric dependency‑injection library for Android. It explains how a *module* declares dependencies, how `single`, `factory`, and `viewModel` scopes control instance creation, and how `get()` fetches those instances automatically. The speaker stresses that, unlike Dagger/Hilt, Koin requires no code generation or reflection, making it easier to start with and fast to build.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concepts are demonstrated in two practical projects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A **Jetpack Compose movie app**—showing a full‑stack example of using Koin for everything from network layer to UI.\n",
      "2. A **plain Android movie app**—illustrating advanced RxJava techniques and how Koin can help wire those components.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why use Koin?**  \n",
      "- Fast setup (no annotation processors or generated code).  \n",
      "- Kotlin‑only DSL – write DI configurations like any other Kotlin code.  \n",
      "- Lightweight (no reflection, no runtime overhead).  \n",
      "- Works seamlessly with Android lifecycle components via the `viewModel` factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the video serves as a primer and practical guide to adopting Koin for modern Android applications.\n"
